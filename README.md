This project was meant to showcase how to run and use a backend server when looking through a database! In the video tutorial found above: The user is able to GET, DELETE, POST, and PUT, requests through insomnia core, which is connected to our ORM ECommerce backend project. I walk through how to source the schema, then we seed the data into the database and run the server so it is live through insomnia, and then we run through some of the requests we can make in the video tutorial!

If you have any questions about the project, feel free to contact me through Linkedin!
